# JavaScript-Project2

This is a countdown website that displays the time left until New Year's Eve from our current time.   
The page shows the current date and time and to include a timer that counts down to the start of the New Year's Eve at 12 a.m. on the 1st January. Technologies I used in this project are: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 
A preview of the completed website for a sample date and time is shown: https://abdifatahali.github.io/JavaScript-Project2/
